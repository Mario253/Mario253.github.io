## About
This is where I'm hosting all of my stuff. Currently it's a platform for the Kirby Copy Ability Database (check the legacy folder for the old projects).
## KCAD
KCAD, or the Kirby Copy Ability Database, is a website where you can see everything you need to know about copy abilities. It's explained pretty well in the website, so go check it out!
