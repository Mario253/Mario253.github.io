## About
This is where I'm hosting all of my stuff. Currently it's being used as a platform for an old school project; soon (February 29), this will change to the Kirby Copy Ability Database.
## Legacy Files
Once the KCAD is online, all the school project files will go into the legacy folder, which means that they won't be accessible unless you enter the path manually.
## KCAD
KCAD, or the Kirby Copy Ability Database, is gonna be a website where you can see everything you need to know about copy abilities. You'll learn more after KCAD goes online.
